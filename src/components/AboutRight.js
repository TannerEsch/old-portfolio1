            Q: Why'd you choose to become a Software Engineer?
            <br/>
            A: After years of doing nothing but waiting, I realized that achieving my goals and becoming the person I want to be isn't something I can passively sit and have take place; I needed to take initiative. So I decided to begin with Software Engineering which serves to break me out of culinary, and into the tech field.
